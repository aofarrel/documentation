# Discovering Data Using Gen3

## Login to Gen3 BioData Catalyst

To view the data that is available to the user on [Gen3 BioData Catalyst \(BDC\)](https://gen3.datastage.io/), please start by going to the [login page](https://gen3.datastage.io/login). At this time, the BDC offers two forms of login, one using a Google account and the other using an NIH login. The NIH login is based on your [eRA Commons account](https://public.era.nih.gov/commons/public/login.do) and access is granted through [dbGaP](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi). Please make sure to use the correct login method that contains access to your available projects.

Once the user has successfully logged in, the user name will appear in the upper right hand corner above the Gen3 Common's tiles.

## Using Exploration

After clicking on the [Exploration](https://internalstaging.datastage.io/explorer) option in the upper right hand toolbar, the user will see a page with summary statistics and facets on the left side.



Using these facets that are located on the left side panel, a user can leverage the DCC harmonized variables to create a custom cohort in the "Cases" tab. At this time, a user can filter based on three categories of information from `Medical History`, `Diagnosis`, and `subject`.
