# Accessibility

Objective: Improve BDCatalyst documentation so that it is more accessible to individuals with disabilities. 

Recommended Action: Add alternative text or “alt” text to images and/or subsequent \(caption\) text so that individuals with visual disabilities can understand what is being explained in the image. In Markdown, this is !\[alternative text\]\(link “this is optional text”\).

Note: The documentation search “DocSearch” is dependent on indexing text and cannot present information contained in images to users searching BDCatalyst documentation. The “[WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)” tool can be used to check for accessibility issues, including alternative text.
