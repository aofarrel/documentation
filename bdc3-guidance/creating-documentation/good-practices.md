# Recommended Practices

## Recommendations for Your Documentation from the Dockstore Example

### Objective

Provide suggested approaches for consistent and usable documentation for the system, platforms, and tools.

### Recommended Practices

* **Use descriptive, clear headings for sections.** For example, update “Terra” to “[Dockstore Integration with Terra](../../community-tools/dockstore-example.md)”. Reason: When users are searching documentation, clear headers like this will be more informative.
* **Use title case for headings.** For example, see “[Dockstore Integration with Terra](../../community-tools/dockstore-example.md)”. When in doubt, use a tool like [https://titlecaseconverter.com/](https://titlecaseconverter.com/). Reason: To use a common/standard approach to facilitate readability.
* **Structure your headers hierarchically**, so h1, h2, h3 \(or in Markdown \#, \#\#, \#\#\#\). Reason: Documentation search works better when your content is organized hierarchically.
* **At the beginning of your documentation, add an objective**, what the user will learn, and give the user an idea about how much time it will take to cover the content. Reason: This allows the user to understand what they expect to learn in a section and how long it will take. 
* **Use clear language from the perspective of new users.** Take a step back, look at your documentation and ask, is it written for novice users or is it from an expert mindset \(i.e. describing actions as simple, easy, etc. and/or skipping steps that a beginner will need\)? Reason: Sometimes we get trapped in thinking like an experienced, expert user; we take certain implicit steps for granted.
* **Use double quotes for menu and submenu items.** For multiple menu and submenu options in a sequence, use the right angle bracket or greater than sign. e.g.: `“Help” > “Check for updates”`. For commands such as ENTER use the backtick in Markdown, e.g. ```ENTER```. Reason: Facilitates readability by using a common/standard approach.
