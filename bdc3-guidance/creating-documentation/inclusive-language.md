Objective: Create a welcoming environment through inclusive language.  
  


* Use Alex.js \([https://alexjs.com](https://alexjs.com)\) online or command line to correct insensitive, inconsiderate language.

* Examples:

Blacklist / Whitelist ⇒ Denylist / Allowlist  
    Master / Slave ⇒ Primary / Replica

* Note: Inclusive language considerations also includes tone. Take a step back, look at your documentation and ask, is it written for novice users or is it from an expert mindset \(i.e. describing actions as simple, easy, etc. and/or skipping steps that a beginner will need\)?
