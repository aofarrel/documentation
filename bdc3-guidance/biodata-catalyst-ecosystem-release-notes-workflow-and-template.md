# BioData Catalyst Ecosystem Release Notes Workflow & Template



### **Release Notes Purpose**

The purpose of BD Catalyst release notes is to provide a brief overview for a user of new key features and functionality that are part of an official release.

Platform specific release notes may also be made available, listed, and linked from the BD Catalyst Release Notes page, but they will not be the primary focus.

### **Workflow:**

1. BDC3 curates links to platforms/services release notes on the  “[Learn & Support](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/learn)” page based on feedback from the teams.
2. The “BioData Catalyst Ecosystem Release Notes” are developed as part of DevOps activities overseen by the Change Control Board \(CCB\). Given that ecosystem-level release features are tracked in Jira, content in Jira should be consulted for relevant release notes content as part of the CCB official release process for the BD Catalyst ecosystem. This is to help insure that work plan activities align with actual releases. QA review may be necessary to ensure alignment. 
   1. Features that were completed during this release period are extracted from Jira using a script to generate template release notes
   2. That template is refined by BDC3 \(User Services\) which does QA to clarify/improve feature language 
   3. BDC3 cross-checks with teams to ensure the descriptions are accurate
3. Once finalized, User Services receives the release notes and posts a new message to BioData Catalyst Forums &gt; Announcements as well as creates a new release in [BD Catalyst Documentation](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/), under the section "BioData Catalyst Release Notes", The release notes are also linked to from the Learn & Support page.
