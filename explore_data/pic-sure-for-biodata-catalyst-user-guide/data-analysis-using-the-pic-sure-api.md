# Data Analysis Using the PIC-SURE API

Once you have refined your queries and created your cohorts you can begin analyzing data using the BioData Catalyst Ecosystem. The followi

**What is the PIC-SURE API?**

Databases exposed through PIC-SURE API encompass a wide heterogeneity of architectures and data organizations underneath. PIC-SURE hides this complexity and exposes the different databases in the same format, allowing researchers to focus on the analysis and medical insights, thus easing the process of reproducible sciences.

**More about PIC-SURE:**

PIC-SURE stands for Patient-centered Information Commons: Standardized Unification of Research Elements. The API is available in two different programming languages, python and R, allowing investigators to query databases in the same way using any of those languages.

PIC-SURE is a large project from which the R/python PIC-SURE API is only a brick. Among other things, PIC-SURE also offers a graphical user interface, allowing research scientists to get quick knowledge about variables and data available for a specific data source.

The PIC-SURE API tutorial notebooks can be accessed from the following Github repository: [https://github.com/hms-dbmi/Access-to-Data-using-PIC-SURE-API/tree/master/NHLBI\_BioData\_Catalyst](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/Access-to-Data-using-PIC-SURE-API/tree/master/NHLBI_BioData_Catalyst)

Or can be accessed directly from your workspace on NHLBI BioData Catalyst [Seven Bridges Platform](https://platform.sb.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/) under Public Projects and choosing the PIC-SURE API.
