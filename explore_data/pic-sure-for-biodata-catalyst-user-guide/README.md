# PIC-SURE for BioData Catalyst User Guide

As part of the [BioData Catalyst](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/) initiative, the Patient Information Commons Standard Unification of Research Elements \(PIC-SURE\) platform has been integrating clinical and genomic datasets from multiple TOPMed and TOPMed related studies funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute \(NHLBI\). The PIC-SURE User Interface allows for an investigator to search available data and conduct feasibility queries, allowing for cohorts to be built in real-time and results to be exported via the PIC-SURE API for analysis.

It is important to note that the BioData Catalyst is consistently onboarding new data that will become available as it is implemented
