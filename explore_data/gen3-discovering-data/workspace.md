# Workspace

When navigating to the Workspace page, a user will be presented with multiple workspace options.

Gen3 BioData Catalyst offers two workspace environments, Jupyter Notebooks and R Studio. At this time, we offer six workspaces, three virtual machine \(vm\) options: a small Jupyter Notebook VM, a large Jupyter Notebook Power VM, and a R Studio VM, plus premade workflow workspaces: Autoencoder Demo, CIP Demo and Tensorflow-Pytorch. To start one, click the launch button.

This will launch the VM, which can take up to five minutes depending upon the size and complexity of the workspace.

Once the VM is ready, the initial screen for the workspace will appear. For scripts and output that need to be saved when the workspace is terminated, please store those files in the `pd/` directory. 

This workspace will persist once the user has logged out of the Gen3 BioData Catalyst system. If the workspace is no longer being used, please terminate the workspace using the `Terminate Workspace` button found at the bottom of the window. Doing this will return the user to the Workspace page with all the workspace options.
