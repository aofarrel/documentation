# Workspace

When navigating to Workspace, a user will be presented with multiple workspace options.

The Gen3 platform offers two workspace environments: Jupyter Notebooks and R Studio. At present, we offer six workspaces:

Virtual machines \(VM\): 

* Small Jupyter Notebook VM
* Large Jupyter Notebook Power VM
* R Studio VM

Pre-made workflow workspaces: 

* Autoencoder Demo
* CIP Demo
* Tensorflow-Pytorch. 

To start one, click the launch button.

This action will launch the VM, which can take up to five minutes depending upon the size and complexity of the workspace.

Once the VM is ready, the initial screen for the workspace will appear. For scripts and output that need to be saved when the workspace is terminated, please store those files in the `pd/` directory. 

This workspace will persist once the user has logged out of the Gen3 BioData Catalyst system. If the workspace is no longer being used, please terminate the workspace using the `Terminate Workspace` button found at the bottom of the window. Doing this will return the user to the Workspace page with all the workspace options.
