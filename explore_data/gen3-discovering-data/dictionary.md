# Dictionary

The Gen3 BioData Catalyst Data Dictionary contains the visualization of the data model for the BioData Catalyst Dictionary. This graph view will display the relationships between nodes, specifically required relationships and node types, which are noted in the legend in the right corner.

To learn more about the node, a user can click on a node. This will initially highlight the relational paths that can be taken to connect to the node to the program node. A "Data Model Structure" list will also appear on the left side toolbar. This will write the node path that is required to reach the node from the program node.

When another node in the path is selected, it will then gray out the other possible paths and only highlight the selected path.
