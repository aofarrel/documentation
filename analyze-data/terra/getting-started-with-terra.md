# Getting Started with Terra

### Accessing Terra

* **BioData Catalyst Powered by Terra URL:** [**https://terra.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/**](https://terra.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/)\*\*\*\*
* **Web Browser:**  Google **Chrome** is the web browser that Terra is designed for, tested with, and runs best on.

### Logging-in to Terra

### Creating a Terra Billing Project

In general, work within Terra is performed in the context of a Terra Billing Project.   
Note: You do **not** necessarily need access to your own Terra Billing Project to use Terra. Tutorial workspaces with open access data will be available to view after you register.

A Terra Billing Project typically contains and is shared by the members of a research team.  
If a Terra user, such as a collaborator or PI, shares a workspace with you and grants you WRITER access, you can compute within that workspace. All charges incurred for that workspace will be tracked through the workspace ownerâ€™s Terra Billing Project.

****This section of a larger article provides instructions for setting-up a new Terra Billing Project.

### **Setting-up a Billing Account**

Note to BioData Catalyst Fellows:  
The billing account setup for Fellows is likely to be different than that for other BioData Catalyst users. Instructions for setting up Fellows billing accounts will be provided at the platform-specific onboarding training.

### Maintaining Data Security in Terra

The Terra platform has a number of features to ensure the security of sensitive data accessed through the platform. Some of these features are in place automatically, while others, like **authorization domains**, are tools designed to give greater control over your data.
