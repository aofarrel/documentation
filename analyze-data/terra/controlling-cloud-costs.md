# Controlling Cloud Costs

The Terra platform is free to use, however operations in Terra - such as running workflows, running Jupyter Notebooks, and accessing and storing data - may incur Google Cloud charges. These will be billed directly to your Terra billing account. 

The following link provides information on key cloud services \(Google Cloud Storage, Google Computer Engine, and Google BigQuery\) and examples to help you make informed decisions around controlling costs on Terra. For up-to-date billing information, see the documentation for GCP Pricing.
