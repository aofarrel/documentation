# Interactive Analysis with Jupyter Notebooks

Terra supports versatile and powerful support for interactive analysis using Jupyer Notebooks, supporting both the Python and R languages.  
The Jupyter Notebooks may be run on a variety of runtime infrastructures, including Spark clusters.  


### Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks

For an introduction to Jupyter Notebooks for those unfamiliar with them, see:

*  ****[**Interactive statistics and visualization with Jupyter notebooks**](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360024898671-Interactive-statistics-and-visualization-with-Jupyter-notebooks) ****This article provides a quick, illustrated introduction to Jupyter Notebooks in Terra. For a more detailed and interactive introduction to the use Jupyter Notebooks, see the example workspace below. ****
* [**Jupyter Notebooks 101**](https://terra.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/#workspaces/help-gatk/Jupyter%20Notebooks%20101) ****This example Workspace provides an interactive tutorial for those new to the use of Jupyter Notebooks. A tutorial is presented in the Notebook itself.
