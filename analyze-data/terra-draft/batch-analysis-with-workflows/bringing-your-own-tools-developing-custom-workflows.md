# Bringing Your Own Tools: Developing Custom Workflows

Docker and the Workflow Description Language \(WDL\) provide powerful flexible capabilities for developing reliable reusable workflows. The Dockstore repository supports convenient publishing of workflows to a broader community.

### Docker

* [**Getting Started with Docker \(Tutorial on Dockstore site\)**](https://docs.dockstore.org/en/develop/getting-started/getting-started-with-docker.html) ****This tutorial introduces the use of Docker by creating a Docker image for the BAMStats tool. It includes information about the benefits of using Docker, and how to test the Docker image. 
* [**Docker Documentation \(Docker website\)**](https://docs.docker.com/) ****The Docker documentation provides a wealth of information about using Docker effectively. 
  * \*\*\*\*[**Docker overview**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/) ****This article provides a concise overview of Docker, including its benefits, architecture and underlying technology.

  * [**WDL Tutorial**](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/sections/360007347652)**s** This set of tutorials provides practical examples that start simply, then covers more advanced topics including multi-step workflows and scatter-gather. ****
    * \*\*\*\*[**Getting Started with WDL** ](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360037117492-Getting-Started-with-WDL) ****This tutorial provides a gentle introduction to the structure and use of the WDL language. ****
* \*\*\*\*[**Getting Started with WDL \(Tutorial on Dockstore site\)**](https://docs.dockstore.org/en/develop/getting-started/getting-started-with-wdl.html) ****This is a continuation of the Docker tutorial above. The basics of the WDL language are presented, followed by instructions for creating a WDL for the BAMStats Docker image, testing the WDL, then releasing this on GitHub.
