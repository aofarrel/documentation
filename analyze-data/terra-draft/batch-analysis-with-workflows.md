# Batch Analysis with Workflows

Terra workflows perform batch processing jobs defined in the Workflow Description Language \(WDL\) on the Cromwell workflow engine.

### Workflow Tutorials

These tutorials will help you get started quickly with Terra workflows.

* \*\*\*\*[**TOPMed Aligner, or, How to Import Data From Gen3 into Terra and Run a Workflow on It**](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-tutorials/tutorials/topmed-aligner-or-how-to-import-data-from-gen3-into-terra-and-run-a-workflow-on-it) ****This tutorial and associated Terra template workspace provides step-by-step instructions for running a workflow on BioData Catalyst data from Gen3. 
* [**Terra-Workflows-Quickstart**](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/fc-product-demo/Terra-Workflows-Quickstart) ****This tutorial provides clear, step-by-step instructions for running workflows using a series of examples. The workflow examples include CRAM-to-BAM and BAM-to-Unmapped-BAM. This includes some introductory information on running a workflow on your own data files.

### **Finding and Using Available WDL Workflows**

Many WDL workflows are conveniently available from the Dockstore tool and workflow repository.

\*\*\*\*[**Importing a Dockstore workflow into Terra**](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360038137292)  
****This article provides instructions for selecting a workflow in Dockstore then conveniently importing that workflow into Terra.  


### Configuring Workflows

Additional information about configuring workflows is provided by the articles below.

* [**Configure a workflow to process your data**](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360026521831-Configure-a-workflow-to-process-your-data) ****This article describes configuring a workflow, which is specifying the values or files for the workflow variables your workflow needs to run. This includes defining Inputs \(i.e. reference files, compute parameters, and input data file names and locations\) and Outputs. 
* \*\*\*\*[**Getting workflows up and running faster with a JSON file**](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360027735471) ****This article describes configuring a WDL workflow using a JSON file to avoid manually typing in workflow inputs and outputs. 

### Terra Workflow Architecture
