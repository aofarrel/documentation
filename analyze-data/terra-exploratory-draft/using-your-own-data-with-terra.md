# Using Your Own Data with Terra



Some researchers may choose to bring their own data to Terra in addition to, or instead of, using BioData Catalyst data from Gen3. This may be done to:

* Extend or enhance the data currently available from Gen3. For example:
  * Bringing additional \(e.g., longitudinal\) phenotypic data to enhance the harmonized metadata available from Gen3
  * Joint variant calling with additional researcher provided genomic data
* Use researcher provided data exclusively

At a high-level, there are two types of data that researchers typically bring to Terra. Data files \(e.g., genomic data, including CRAM and VCF data\), and metadata \(e.g., tables of clinical/phenotypic or other data, typically regarding the subjects in their study\). These are described separately below.

### Data Files

There are two ways a researcher's data files may be made available in Terra:

1. By uploading data to the researcher's workspace bucket.

2. By enabling Terra to access the researcher's data in a researcher managed Google bucket.

### Metadata

The ways in which a researcher may import metadata to the Terra Data tables are described in these articles.
