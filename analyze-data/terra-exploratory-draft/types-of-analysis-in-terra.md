* **Batch processing with Workflows** The batch workflow features of Terra provide support for computationally intensive, long running, and large scale analysis.
* **Interactive analysis with Jupyter Notebooks** The interactive analysis features of Terra support interactive data exploration, including the use of statistical methods and graphical display. Versatile and powerful interactive analysis is provided through Jupyter Notebooks in both Python and the R languages.
