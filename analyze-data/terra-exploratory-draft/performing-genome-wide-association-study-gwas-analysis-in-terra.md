# Performing Genome Wide Association Study \(GWAS\) Analysis in Terra

Terra provides powerful support for performing Genome Wide Association Study \(GWAS\) analysis. The following featured and template workspaces include Jupyter notebooks for phenotypic and genomic data preparation \(using Hail\) and workflows \(using GENESIS\) to perform GWAS. We will continue to provide more 

### Featured Workspace

### Template Workspace

This template is an example workspace that asks researchers to export TOPMed projects \(for which they have access\) into an example template for conducting a GWAS. Accommodating other datasets may require modifying many parts of this notebook. Inherently, the notebook is an interactive analysis where decisions are made as you go. It is not recommended that the notebook be applied to another dataset without careful thought.
