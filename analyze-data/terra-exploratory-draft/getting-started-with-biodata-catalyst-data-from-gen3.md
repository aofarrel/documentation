# Getting Started with BioData Catalyst Data from Gen3

BioData Catalyst powered by Gen3 provides data for many projects and supports conveniently search across the vast set of subjects  to identify the best available cohort for research analysis. These searchers are based on harmonized phenotypic variables, and the searches may be performed both within and across studies.

When a desired cohort has been identified, it may be conveniently "handed-off" to Terra for analysis.

Optionally, this dataset may be enhanced with additional metadata from dbGaP, or extended to include additional researcher provided subject data.

This page provides necessary information for all researchers using BioData Catalyst data from Gen3. It includes information about:

* Accessing and selecting subject data in Gen3
* Handing-off selected subject data from Gen3 to Terra
* Using the fine-grained Gen3 graph data model within Terra
* Linking Terra to Gen3 to enable user data access
* A description of the GA4GH DRS protocol and data identifiers used by Terra to access data files from Gen3
