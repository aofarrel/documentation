# Terra \(draft\)



BioData Catalyst powered by Terra is a user-friendly system for doing bioinformatics in the cloud. Terra workspaces integrate data, analysis tools, and built-in security components to deliver smooth research flows from data to results.

This set of pages is a starting point for learning the use Terra in the context of the BioData Catalyst ecosystem.

The first page provides information necessary for all BioData Catalyst users of Terra.

Then instructions are provided accessing data and performing analysis that quickly gets to hands-on use of Terra through featured/template workspaces developed to support learning and research analysis.

The information is presented in an order intended to work well for most BioData Catalyst researchers. Yet, after working through the first page, feel free to jump around to the pages that interest you most. Eventually, though, most researchers will need to be familiar with most of the information contained in the all of these pages.

The Terra online documentation provides a wealth of information on using Terra. If you do not find what you are looking for in these pages, please see the full set of Terra documentation available here: [Terra Documentation](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us)
