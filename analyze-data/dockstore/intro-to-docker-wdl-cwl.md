# Intro to Docker, WDL, CWL

## Introduction to Docker

Docker is a fantastic tool for creating light-weight containers to run your tools. It gives you a fast, VM-like environment for Linux where you can automatically install dependencies, make configurations, and setup your tool exactly the way you want, just as you would on a “normal” Linux host. You can then quickly and easily share these Docker images with the world using registries like Quay.io \(indexed by Dockstore\), Docker Hub, and GitLab.

## Introduction to Workflow Languages

There are multiple workflow languages currently available to use with docker technology. In the BioData Catalyst ecosystem, SevenBridges uses CWL and Terra uses WDL. To learn more about how these language compare and differ, read Dockstore's documentation on [tools](https://docs.dockstore.org/en/develop/getting-started/dockstore-tools.html) and [workflows](https://docs.dockstore.org/en/develop/getting-started/dockstore-workflows.html). 

Once you have picked what language works best for you, prepare your pipeline for analysis in the cloud with these tutorials aimed at bioinformaticians:
