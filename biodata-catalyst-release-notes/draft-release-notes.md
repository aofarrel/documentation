# YYYY-MM-DD Draft Release Notes Workflow and Template

**Release Notes Workflow:**

1. Jira issue triggers BDC3 User Services to create YYYY-MM-DD Release Note page with overview statement on BDC3's GitBook
2. Platforms/services POCs with BDC3 GitBook write access \(see User Services for write access\) use template provided below to add their release notes to the page

**FOR BDC3 USER SERVICES:**

**Release Note Page Name** - YYYY-MM-DD + Release Note

**Overview** - BDC3 User Services will include this overview statement at the beginning of the release note: "Release notes are provided by platforms and services in the BioData Catalyst ecosystem on a periodic basis to help our user community stay up-to-date on what has changed in the system. Platform and service release notes include summaries, improvements, and fixes. Release notes for YYYY-MM-DD are available below:"
