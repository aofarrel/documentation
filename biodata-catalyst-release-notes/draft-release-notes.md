# Draft Release Template

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_notes):

There is no standard format for release notes that is followed throughout different organizations. Organizations normally adopt their own formatting styles based on the requirement and type of the information to be circulated. The content of release notes also vary according to the release type. For products that are at testing stage and that are newly released, the content is usually more descriptive compared to release notes for bug fixes and feature enhancements, which are usually brief. Release notes may include the following sections:

Header â€“ Document Name \(i.e. Release Notes\), product name, release number, release date, note date, note version, etc. 

Overview - A brief overview of the product and changes, in the absence of other formal documentation. 

Purpose - A brief overview of the purpose of the release note with a listing of what is new in this release, including bug fixes and new features. 

Issue Summary - A short description of the bug or the enhancement in the release. 

Steps to Reproduce - The steps that were followed when the bug was encountered. 

Resolution - A short description of the modification/enhancement that was made to fix the bug. 

End-User Impact - What different actions are needed by the end-users of the application. This should include whether other functionality is impacted by these changes. Support Impacts - Changes required in the daily process of administering the software. 

Notes - Notes about software or hardware installation, upgrades and product documentation \(including documentation updates\) 

Disclaimers - Company and standard product related messages. e.g.; freeware, anti-piracy, duplication etc.. See also Disclaimer. 

Contact - Support contact information.
