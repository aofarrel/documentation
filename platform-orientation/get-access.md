# Get Access

**Objectives:** 

* To provide instructions to new BioData Catalyst users on how to create accounts and access the BioData Catalyst suite of services and tools. 
* To point new users to resources that will help them through initial issues they may have.

To start, please note, it may take up to _1 week_ to obtain approval from a principal investigator \(PI\) and be allowed access to the suite of services and tools available via BioData Catalyst. A new user request must be made by a PI \(list?\) using the **Request to add BioData Catalyst Users Form**. NHLBI will review and convey a list to the Data Access Committee \(DAC\) weekly. Once approved, the new user can be added to the system.
