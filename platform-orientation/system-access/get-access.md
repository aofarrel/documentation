# Get Access

**Objectives:** 

* To provide instructions to new BioData Catalyst users on how to create accounts and access the BioData Catalyst suite of services and tools. 
* To point new users to resources that will help them through initial issues they may have.

To start, please note, it may take up to _1 week_ to obtain approval from a principal investigator \(PI\) and be allowed access to the suite of services and tools available via BioData Catalyst. A new user request must be made by a PI \(list?\) using the **Request to add BioData Catalyst Users Form**. NHLBI will review and convey a list to the Data Access Committee \(DAC\) weekly. Once approved, the new user can be added to the system.

Note:   
  
When requesting access, make sure you are using the correct eRA Commons ID and/or Google account that you will use to access BioData Catalyst.   
  
If you have accessed one of the BioData Catalyst services and tools previously, your prior account information \(cloud credits\) may be carried over.
